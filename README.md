# Chat with Ionic 3 and Firebase
Simple chat using **Ionic** 3 and **Firebase**. It's develop for a workshop, so in ***master*** branch there is the  prepared code for that purpose. There are several ***TODOs*** in the code that it is necessary to fill.

In ***completed*** branch there is the complete code.

# Environment
The minimun software that must be installed in each computer will be:

*  [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Ionic 3](https://ionicframework.com/docs/v1/guide/installation.html)
* [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/es/latest/guide/cli/)
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/es/download/package-manager/)

# IDE
We recomend an IDE such as:
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)

# Run project
If someone wants to go to the workshop with everything ready, after installing all the software, he/she can run the project (there will be compilation problems, no worries) in this way:
* **Install firebase plugin**: `npm install --save firebase`
* **Run the project**: `ionic serve`
